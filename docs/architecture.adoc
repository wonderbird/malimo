== Acknowledgements

This documentation is based on the https://docs.arc42.org[arc42] template. The examples provided there and in
https://www.dokchess.de/["DokChess als Beispiel f√ºr arc42"] act as templates for some sections. Many thanks to all
contributors for your valuable work.

The architecture document is grown as needed. Chapter numbers follow the suggestions from
https://docs.arc42.org[arc42]. Numbering gaps are a consequence.

== 8 Concepts

=== 8.1 Create a Release

==== Prerequisite

- The link:../CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG.md] must be up-to-date.

==== Trigger the Release Pipeline

After a pull request has been merged to `main`, create and push a version tag:

```shell
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -a "v0.1.5-alpha" -m "v0.1.5-alpha"
git push --tags
```

This will trigger the full link:../.github/workflows/dotnet.yml[GitHub Action to publish a new release]. The workflow will finally produce the https://github.com/wonderbird/malimo/releases[GitHub release] and attach the installation packages for the target operating systems.

==== Update Homebrew Tools

After a successful release, update corresponding cask in the https://github.com/wonderbird/homebrew-tools[Homebrew tap wonderbird/tools]:

. Download the release artifacts for macOS, e.g. to `~/Downloads/malimo*`
. `shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/malimo*`
. Update the `version` and `sha256` entries for the new release
. Test the update locally using `brew upgrade malimo`
. Publish the changes
. Ensure the test pipelines are green
